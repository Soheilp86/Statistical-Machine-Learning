# Statistical Machine Learning (SML) Course

Welcome to the Statistical Machine Learning (SML) course! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and labs designed for a 55-minute class session each.

## About the Course

Machine Learning (ML) is a dynamic field at the crossroads of data science, mathematics, statistics, and computer science. It involves techniques that allow machines to learn from data and improve over time. This course integrates ML algorithms with statistical thinking, covering:

- Basics of Python
- Regression and classification
- Model analysis and performance metrics
- Cross-validation and data transformations
- Dimension reduction
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Ensemble methods

## Course Materials
