# Statistical-Machine-Learning
 Jupyter notebooks and labs for a course on the Statistical Machine Learning (SML).

 Machine learning (ML) is a growing field at the intersection of data science, mathematics,
statistics, and computer science. Roughly speaking, it is a collection of methods and techniques that enable
machines to learn from data and automatically improve their performance. This course blends the algorithmic
perspective of machine learning in computer science and the predictive perspective of statistical thinking. Topics
include regression, classification, algorithmic analysis of models, performance metrics and prediction, cross-
validation, data transformations, dimension reduction, supervised and unsupervised learning and ensemble
methods. 

SML is an ongoing course, with more materials to be added.
Topics include:
