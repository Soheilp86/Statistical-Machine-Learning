This inaccuracy is part of the **reducible error**, meaning it can be reduced with better data or larger sample sizes.\n","\n","### 2. **Model Bias (Assumption of Linear Model)**\n","\n","\n","- The linear model estimates the **best linear approximation** to the true underlying function, but it ignores the possibility that the true function could be non-linear. This bias is part of the **systematic error** in the model.\n","- While model bias is harder to quantify directly, we acknowledge that even with perfect coefficient estimates, the model might not capture the true nature of the data.\n","\n","### 3. **Random Error $\\epsilon$ (Irreducible Error)**\n","\n","- The model includes a random error term, denoted $\\epsilon$, which accounts for factors that affect the response but are not captured by the predictors in the model. This error represents the randomness inherent in the data that cannot be predicted or modeled.\n","- Even if we knew the exact values of the true coefficients, the predictions $\\hat{Y}$ would still not be perfect because of this **irreducible error**.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","### Comparison of Confidence vs. Prediction Intervals:\n","\n","To account for both the uncertainty in the coefficient estimates (reducible error) and the random error $\\epsilon$ (irreducible error), we use confidence and prediction intervals.\n","\n","\n","1. To quantify the fisrt uncertainty (reducible error), we can compute confidence intervals for the predicted values $\\hat{y}$. A confidence interval estimates the range within which the true mean response lies, given the uncertainty in the coefficient estimates.\n","\n","2. **Prediction Intervals**: Provide a range for individual future observations, considering both coefficient uncertainty and random error, making them wider than confidence intervals. A prediction interval gives the range within which we expect the actual value of $ Y$  for a new observation to fall.\n","\n","A prediction interval gives the range within which we expect the actual
